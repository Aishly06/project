        Booking meeting rooms in advance to be ready for a meeting and avoid conflicts with other meetings.
        With a meeting room booking system, people are able to search for and book a meeting room in advance, 
        based on their needs and wishes. Employees can book meeting rooms, based on number of participants in meeting by checking out the capacity of available rooms,
        and they can book a room by mentioning start and end time of the meeting.
        A meeting room booking system provides insights into the availability of rooms. This makes it clear to everybody which rooms are occupied, and which are not. 
        It also provides the admin with functionality to view the bookings of room, add or delete a room as well.
        This system makes it easier for everyone in the organisation to have the right meeting room at required time without any conflicts.
